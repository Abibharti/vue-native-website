title: Declarative Rendering
type: guide

At the core of Vue Native is a system that enables us to declaratively render data using straightforward template syntax:

``` html
<template>
  <view>
    <text>{{ message }}</text>
  </view>
</template>
```
```JS
<script>
export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      message: "Hello World"
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

We have already created our very first `Vue Native` app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a template string, but under the hood a lot of work is being done. The data and the native UI elements are now linked, and everything is now **reactive**.

In addition to text interpolation, we can also bind element attributes like this:

``` html
<template>
  <view>
    <button v-bind:title="message" v-bind:on-press="handleBtnPress"/>
  </view>
</template>
```
```JS
<script>
export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      message: "Hello World"
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleBtnPress: function() {
      alert('Btn Press');
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

Here we are encountering something new. The `v-bind` attribute. This attribute is called a **directive**. Directives are prefixed with `v-` to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue Native, which internal bind with the React Native props. Then-as you may have guessed-they apply special reactive behavior in re-rendering. Here, it is basically saying "keep this element's `title` attribute up-to-date with the `message` property on the Vue instance."

<div class="hello-world-container">
  <div class="hello-world-wrapper">
    <img src="/images/btn_helloWorld.png" class="img-wrapper" />
  </div>
  <div class="hello-world-wrapper">
    <img src="/images/btn_helloWorld_press.png" class="img-wrapper" />
  </div>
</div>
